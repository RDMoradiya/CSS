(1) what are the benifits of using css?
<ans>
    1.... Compatibility Across Devices = "Responsive web design matters. In today’s day and age, web pages must be fully visible and easily navigable on all devices. Whether mobile or tablet, desktop, or even smart TV, CSS combines with HTML to make responsive design possible."
    2.... Easy Formatting Changes = "If you need to change the format of a specific set of pages, it’s easy to do so with CSS. There’s no need to fix every individual page. Just edit the corresponding CSS stylesheet and you’ll see changes applied to all the pages that are using that style sheet."
    3.... Quicker Development Time = "With CSS, you can apply specific formatting rules and styles to multiple pages with one string of code. One cascading style sheet can be replicated across several website pages. If, for instance, you have product pages that should all have the same formatting, look, and feel, writing CSS rules for one page will suffice for all pages of that same type."
    4.... Better User Experience = "CSS not only makes web pages easy on the eye, it also allows for user-friendly formatting. When buttons and text are in logical places and well organized, user experience improves."    5.... Faster Page Speed = "More code means slower page speed. And CSS enables you to use less code. CSS allows you to use one CSS rule and apply it to all occurrences of a certain tag within an HTML document.'

2) what are the disadvantages of CSS?
<ans>
    1.... Cross-Browser Issues = "Implementing initial CSS changes on a website is accessible on the developer’s end. However, you will have to confirm the compatibility if the CSS displays similar change effects on all the browsers. It is simple since CSS works differently on different browsers."
    2.... Confusion due to many CSS levels = "The programming language world is indeed complicated for non-developers and beginners. Moreover, different levels of CSS f.e. CSS; CSS 2; CSS 3 can be pretty confusing for most of the users."
    3.... Security Issues = "Security is important in today’s world driven by technology and data. One of the major disadvantages of CSS is that it has limited security."
    4.... Be Ready to Fix HTML Tags = "In practice, it is often necessary to fix not only one CSS file but also HTML tags associated with CSS selectors. It sometimes significantly increases the editing time and testing as well."
    5.... Different Layout Display = "If browsers are outdated, the same CSS data may be interpreted differently by them."
    6.... Extra Work for Developers = "Design services are required to consider and test all CSS codes across different browsers for compatibility. Due to developers testing compatibility for different browsers, their workload increases."
